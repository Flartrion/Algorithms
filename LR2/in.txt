Tremble, you weaklings, cower in fear
I am your ruler - land, sea, and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system's locked in for military gluttons
I rule on land, air, and sea
I pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head
To spit into the wind

I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Heh, survival, such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps
I rule land, air, and sea
Pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Well only time will tell

I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace
