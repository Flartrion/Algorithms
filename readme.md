Source files lie beneath according LR* and CW folders (CW standing for "Course Work").

.txt file used for testing in LR2 is located together with its source files.

Both LR3 and LR3Testing include testing files used.

Both CW and CWTesting include testing files used also.

Everything should be easily compilable with usage of CMake.

Tests are intended to be compiled after main programs themselves are (as they also compile libraries which tests use).
